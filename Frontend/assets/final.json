These benchmark standards remain intact, but Stobart also understands the customer service, employment practices and environmental challenges that face modern businesses today. Over the last few years the Group has evolved beyond its position as an independent road transport and logistics business to a leading UK provider of multinational transport and logistics solutions. Under new regulations, Eddie Stobart has introduced a new high-volume Envirotrailer to its ever expanding fleet to help boost the economy, cut congestion and slash carbon emissions from the haulage industry. The eco-trailer is being operated under a Vehicle Special Order as part of the Department for Transport's 10-year trial of semi-trailers that are one and two metres longer than the then maximum length of 13.6 metres. The extended trailers allow operators to carry higher volumes of goods but still meet the current regulations with regard to maximum permitted weights and turning circles. The first UK delivery utilised a 15.65 metre trailer with two steering rear axles - providing impressive manoeuvrability and less wear and tear to the UK road network. The trailer was packed with 54 retail cages and demonstrated a 20% increase in payload allowing for the number of trucks on UK roads to be decreased. This model features the newly tooled Super Curtainside Trailer. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ITEM IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A TOY, THIS ITEM IS FOR COLLECTORS.

These benchmark standards remain intact, but Stobart also understands the customer service, employment practices and environmental challenges that face modern businesses today. Over the last few years the Group has evolved beyond its position as an independent road transport and logistics business to a leading UK provider of multinational transport and logistics solutions. Under new regulations, Eddie Stobart has introduced a new high-volume Envirotrailer to its ever expanding fleet to help boost the economy, cut congestion and slash carbon emissions from the haulage industry. The eco-trailer is being operated under a Vehicle Special Order as part of the Department for Transport's 10-year trial of semi-trailers that are one and two metres longer than the then maximum length of 13.6 metres. The extended trailers allow operators to carry higher volumes of goods but still meet the current regulations with regard to maximum permitted weights and turning circles. The first UK delivery utilised a 15.65 metre trailer with two steering rear axles - providing impressive manoeuvrability and less wear and tear to the UK road network. The trailer was packed with 54 retail cages and demonstrated a 20% increase in payload allowing for the number of trucks on UK roads to be decreased.
